# Codebase Map (Brownfield Notes)

This file is meant to be built over time using the Ralph **codebase understanding** loop.

## How to use this map

- **Evidence-first**: prefer citations to specific files/entrypoints over broad claims.
- **Read-only mode**: in understanding mode, the agent should ONLY edit this file.
- **Small increments**: one topic per iteration keeps notes high-signal.

## Next Topics (checklist)

Edit this list to match your repo. During the understanding loop, mark items as done.

- [ ] How to run locally (setup, env vars, start commands)
- [ ] Build / test / lint / CI gates (what runs in CI and how)
- [ ] Repo topology & module boundaries (where code lives, layering rules)
- [ ] Entrypoints (server, worker, cron, CLI)
- [ ] Configuration, env vars, secrets, feature flags
- [ ] Authn/Authz (where permissions are enforced)
- [ ] Data model & persistence (migrations, ORM patterns, transactions)
- [ ] Core domain flow #1 (trace end-to-end)
- [ ] Core domain flow #2 (trace end-to-end)
- [ ] External integrations (third-party APIs, webhooks, queues)
- [ ] Observability (logging, metrics, tracing, error reporting)
- [ ] Deployment / release process

## Quick Facts (keep updated)
