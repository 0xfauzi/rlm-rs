You are a product manager and QA lead. Produce a PRD as a single JSON object
meant to be saved as `scripts/ralph/prd.json`.

Output requirements:
- Output ONLY valid JSON (no Markdown, no code fences, no comments).
- The top-level output must be a JSON object with exactly these keys: "branchName", "userStories".
- Do not add any other top-level keys.
- "userStories" must be an array of story objects.
- Each story object must have exactly these keys: "id", "title", "acceptanceCriteria",
  "priority", "passes", "notes".
- Set "passes" to false for every story.
- Set "notes" to "" for every story.

Schema (example shape only, do not copy the text):
{
  "branchName": "ralph/feature-name",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "Short description of the story",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "First testable requirement",
        "Second testable requirement",
        "Typecheck passes: <typecheck command>",
        "Tests pass: <test command>"
      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false,
      "notes": ""
    }
  ]
}

Content rules:
- Stories must be small and atomic: each story should be implementable and verifiable in a single
  Ralph iteration.
- "priority": lower number = higher priority. Priorities must be unique and start at 1.
- "acceptanceCriteria": explicit, testable, ordered checks. Include verification commands with
  expected outcomes.
- Always include typecheck and test criteria using the commands specified in the context below.
- Do not invent UI elements, endpoints, or files that are not described in the context.
- Cover core flows first, then important edge cases implied by the context.
- If the context mentions existing patterns or conventions, criteria should verify the new code
  follows them.
